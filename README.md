# self-supervised-learning-SSL-Contrastive-Domain-Adaptation
Contrastive learning is a powerful self-supervised technique for domain adaptation (DA) in PyTorch. It trains models to bring similar samples (positive pairs) closer and push different samples (negative pairs) apart, which helps in learning domain-invariant features.
